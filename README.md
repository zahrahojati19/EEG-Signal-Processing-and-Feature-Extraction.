# EEG Signal Processing and Feature Extraction
I developed a comprehensive pipeline for processing EEG signals, applying spatial and temporal filters, and extracting discriminative features using the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm. 
The project aimed to enhance the quality of EEG data and improve feature extraction for downstream classification tasks, such as motor imagery classification in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).
Various classification and clustering techniques has been implemented to help us find the most efficient method with the highest accuracy.
